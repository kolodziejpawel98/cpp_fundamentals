IntVector â€” Simple Dynamic Integer Array in C++

This project implements a basic dynamic integer array similar to std::vector<int>.
It focuses on practicing key C++ concepts: manual memory management with pointers, use of references, const correctness, and proper copy semantics (copy constructor and assignment operator).

The goal is to build a class that supports adding elements (push_back), accessing elements (get), and manages resources safely without memory leaks.
